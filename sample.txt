The recent updates include fixing the out-of-stock message display for disabled variants, greying out variants with zero quantity, and adding crossed-out pills for such variants. The navigation bar and nested menu styles were enhanced, with improvements made to menu positioning when the number of menus increases, and the background colors and gradients were refined. Functionality was added to replace existing categories and subcategories with new ones, and display issues for categories without subcategories were resolved by showing them as sections. Styling inconsistencies for new eCommerce categories were also addressed, ensuring even display for menus with or without subcategories. Full themes and styles were implemented for both the website and login page. Several bug fixes were completed, including resolving errors during the stock account module upgrade, fixing sub-menu display issues and product detail views for public users, and correcting tax displays in migrated product data. Currently, work is ongoing to finalize styles for categories without sub-subcategories and to test all recently implemented functionalities.
